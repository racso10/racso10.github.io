### Bio & Research Interests
I am currently a third year PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Beijing Jiaotong University, under the supervision of Professor [Zhang Shuo](http://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/9278/). I received my bachelor’s degree from Fuzhou University in 2018.

My research interests are machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision.

My recent working topics include but are not limited to:

- Light Field Reconstruction
- Low-level vision (De-noising, Super-Resolusion, De-occlusion)
- Neural Rendering
